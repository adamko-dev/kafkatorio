**Work-in-progress**

The Kafkatorio Events mod is part of Kafkatorio, an in-development platform that exports data from
Factorio to Apache Kafka, a event-based database. This allows for external systems to access
Factorio data.

This mod will not work without additional infrastructure. Once development is completed, setup
instructions will be made available.
